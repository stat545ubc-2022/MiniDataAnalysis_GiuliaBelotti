# MiniDataAnalysis_GiuliaBelotti

This repository contains my MiniDataAnalysis project for the course STAT545, which includes **MiniDataAnalysis1**, **MiniDataAnalysis2** and an **output** folder. The MiniDataAnalysis is one of the main assignments for this course. 

To explore my project, you should get familiar with the folders:

- In the first folder, **MiniDataAnalysis1**, I familiarize myself with the dataset "apt_buildings" and I try to answer some research questions using data on new apartments in the city of Toronto. I mostly explore my dataset by completing some exercises assigned in the course STAT545. Exercises include creating new variables, investigating missing values, filtering observations and creating new tibbles. Furthermore, here I engage with some "summarizing" and "graphing" exercises. 
- In the second folder, **MiniDataAnalysis2**, you can find a better version of the dataset under consideration, since I tidy it and keep working on trying to answer my research question(s). 
- In the third folder, **output**, you can find the .csv and rds. versions of a chunck of code I created for my project, more specifically for the second part of the data analysis.
